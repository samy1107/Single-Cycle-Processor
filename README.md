# Single-Cycle-Processor (verilog)
This project is a Verilog implementation of a **MIPS single-cycle processor**, based on the classic architecture described in computer organization textbooks. It supports a subset of MIPS instructions and executes each instruction in one clock cycle.

## ⚙️ Features

- Single-cycle datapath and control
- Instruction types supported: R-type, I-type, and basic J-type
- Modules: ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Data Memory, Instruction Memory, PC
- Verilog testbench with example instruction memory
